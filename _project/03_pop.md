Proof-of-Performance is an algorithm that rewards the token pools operators based on the value and the performance of their pools. The operators are rewarded in GRG, an Ethereum ERC-20 compliant token.

The Rigoblock incentive system allows the token pools to be operated without direct fee charges, and aligns the interests of the different stakeholders.
