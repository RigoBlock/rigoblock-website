The parameters of the Proof-of-Performance algorithm, which determine the resulting overall inflation, are set by the token holders.
The rationale is based on game theory: token holders have an incentive to set the parameters to 0, in order to create 0 inflation.
Since the algorithm provides continuous incentives for further development of the ecosystem, however, the GRG token holders have the incentive to set the minimum parameters which allows for optimal network operations.
