Rigoblock exists to reinvent the asset management industry 
making it accessible to everyone (everyone's access)
enabling full transparency (real time tracking)
and empowering rigorous meritocracy (proof of performance)

We aim to create a new generation of traders and a new level of asset management system. 
Simple, transparent, meritocratic, democratic.
