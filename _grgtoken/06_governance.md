The parameters of the Proof-of-Performance algorithm, which determine the resulting overall inflation, are set by the token holders.
The rationale is based on game theory: token holders have an incentive to set the parameters to 0, in order to create 0 inflation.
However, since the RigoBlock protocol has a continuous funding model, which are used to further develop the ecosystem and attract external actors, the GRG token holders have an incentive to set the minimum parameters which allow for optimal network functioning.
