GRG is a preminted token. 1,500,000 GRGs our of a total 10,000,000 GRGs are allocated to the public public contribution period.
Tokens are distributed at a maximum price of 8 USD per token and a minimum price of 3 USD per token.
All allocated tokens will be distributed to the public.
This model ensures that there are practically no unsold tokens and the final price of the token is a result of the matching between demand and offer, with a cap and a floor (a maximum and a minimum price) to avoid market abuse.
